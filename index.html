        <p><strong>Welcome to my first code review.</strong> In this review we demonstrate our new found skill from three nights of coding class. On this little website you'll see a bit about me. The photograph above is a picture of my dog, Lily, taken in our backyard. She's a ten year old collie and other than work she's what my life pretty much revolves around. Take a closer look at that photo . . . doesn't she have an amazing nose?</p>

        <p><strong>Some other things you'll encounter</strong> on this website is links to some of the websites I like and my current hobbies. My ordered list has links to websites that I spend a little time on. My fabulous bulleted list shares how I spend my precious freetime, when I'm not doing chores, running errands, or catching up on sleep. For my job, I work at <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/"><strong>Dark Horse Comics</strong></a>. I've been there for 17 years as a graphic designer and then as art director managing our in-house graphic design department. My day is spent talking with people, coordinating, reviewing designers work, and assigning projects. It leaves little time for design or learning new technologies and that is why I signed up for the <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/intro-to-programming/"><strong>Intro to Programming Class</strong></a>. So far it has been challenging, and I could use more time, but overall it feels good to get out of my well-won comfort zone.</p>
